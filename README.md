# Week Four Challenge : Console-Finances

## Description
This challenge depicts a typical real-life daily work activity of analysing financial data. 

This was aimed at helping me understand how to solve this type of data analysis, while developing the skills of independent research, understanding the acceptance criteria and collaboration with colleagues (both senior and same level) when needed. 

This challenge analyses the business growth over a period of time (Six years and two months).This was done by calculating the profit and losses as well as tracking the monthly changes over time. All was done using JavaScript.

In the course of this challenge i learnt how to sum up a particular element in a multidimentional and two-dimensional array. I also learnt how to use the `push()` to save values in an array. I understood the use of for loop better and also learnt how to check for minimum and maximum values in an array.

The codes were annotated carefully to allow anyone that accessed it to understand it easily and for continuity.
